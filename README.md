# Express Server Template (Typescript)

This is a simple template for a express server with typescript.

## How to use

First you need to install all the dependencies using the command `yarn install`.

After, you can execute the following commands:

- develpment mode (watching for changes using nodemon): `yarn run dev`.
- build the project: `yarn run build`.
- start the project: `yarn run start`.

If you want to change server port set the `PORT` value in  `.env` file (default server port $3000$).
